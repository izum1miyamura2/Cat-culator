## Project Description

Cat-culator is a gloriously useless app that converts everyday units into cat equivalents. Meters? Nah. That’s 5 cats long. Liters? Try bowls of milk. Time? Cat naps only. It’s the purr-fect way to measure anything.

---

## The Problem (that doesn’t exist)

Have you ever looked at a 2-meter stick and wondered, “But how many cats is that?”  
Exactly. Nobody did. Until now.

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Cat-culator translates real-world values into feline-friendly units. From measuring your hallway in cats to checking if your groceries weigh more than a chunky feline — we’ve got you covered.
